/**
 *      What are iterative statements /Loops?
 *          - Iterative statements, also known as loops, are programming constructs
 *              that allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly based on a certain
 *              condition.
 *          - They are commonly used when there is a need to perform a repetitive
 *              task or when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
 *
 *          There are several types of loops in most programming languages, including:
 *
 *          1. While loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
 *          2. For loop: Executes a block of code a specific number of times,
 *              typically based on the size of a collection or an explicit count.
 *          3. Do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, and then
 *              continues to execute it as long as a specified condition is true.
 *          4. For-each loop: A special type of loop that is used to iterate over each element in a collection.
 *
 *              Loops are an essential tool for programmers, as they allow for
 *              efficient and concise code that can be used to process large amounts
 *              of data or perform repetitive tasks.
